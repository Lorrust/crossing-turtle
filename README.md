# Crossing Turtle
A road crossing game made with the turtle module on Python, featuring increasingly difficult levels.
* In order to move the turtle, press Space.
* For each completed level, the obstacles become faster, which makes it harder to progress.
* Feel free to tweak the values to see how they impact the game.
